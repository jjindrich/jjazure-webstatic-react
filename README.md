# Seamless API Development with Data API Builder for your Static Web Apps

### Goals

Have you ever walked into a store, did some shopping, and headed back home only to find that you forgot to buy 60% of the items you needed to get?
I struggle with this very same issue and so I decided to create the ‘Smart Shopping Planner’, an application that will help me keep track of the items I need to buy and that I can easily update before and after shopping.

Smart Shopping Planner is a React application built using JavaScript, that stores data in an Azure SQL database. In this blog, I want to show you how incredibly easy it was to provide REST endpoints (you can work with GraphQL too) to connect the app to the database.
